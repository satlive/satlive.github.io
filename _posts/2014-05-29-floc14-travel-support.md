Application Deadline is June 8, 2014.
Applicants will be informed of decision by June 17, 2014.

FLoC has some additional funds to provide travel grants of up to $750 for student attendees of FLoC’14.
Funds can be requested to cover airfare and lodging (registration fees and meals will not be funded).
We expect to award about 100 grants. The application deadline is June 8, 2014, and recipients will be
notified by June 17.

Funds will be provided after the conference, upon submission of receipts and a short report detailing
the student’s experience at and benefit from FLoC’14 (these reports will be used to compile a final
report to our sponsors). Awardees are expected to spend up to one day during the meeting helping with
logistics.

Applicants’ advisors should send a brief statement certifying their educational status and describing
their financial need, and merits. Special efforts will be made to bring to FLoC students from
under-represented groups. Applications must be received by the deadline. Applicants are required to
apply at the following web form:
