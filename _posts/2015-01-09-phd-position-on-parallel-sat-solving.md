At the Institute of Artificial Intelligence the Chair of Knowledge Representation and
Reasoning offers a position as member of the academic staff starting at the next possible date. 

The current funding for the position is for two years, but we aim at an extension of the project. The period of employment is governed by § 2 Fixed Term Research Contracts Act (Wissenschaftszeitvertragsgesetz - WissZeitVG). The position is part of the DFG Project "Parallel SAT Solving".

A central goal of the project is to develop a parallel solving approach for the satisfiability testing (SAT) problem, and to implement an according system. To reach this goal, several sub goals should be achieved, whose solution can results in a PhD thesis. The group has contacts to the international research community, and systems of the group are already competitive. Hence, the position furthermore offers the opportunity for networking and international collaboration.

Tasks: designing an abstract reduction system for parallel SAT solving and an approach to emit unsatisfiability proofs for parallel SAT solvers with respect to the state of the art in modern SAT solving; proving properties of the proposed systems; designing parallel formula simplification techniques; participation at international conferences.

Requirements: very good or good university degree (master or equivalent diploma degree) in computer science or mathematics; good programming skills in imperative programming; experience with modeling abstract reduction systems/rewriting systems; experience in propositional logic; good programming skills in C/C++; very good English skills. Experience in the following areas is helpful: parallel programming, low-level programming, constraint programming, propositional proof complexity.
