CFP: Extended Deadline for 11th International Workshop on Boolean Problems (IWSBP’14)

Freiberg (Sachs.), Germany, September 17 - 19, 2014

## Important Dates

* Submission deadline: May 10, 2014 (EXTENDED DEADLINE)

* Notification of acceptance: June 6, 2014

* Final version due: July 6, 2014

 

The workshop on Boolean problems has an emphasis on the problems related to the solution of
all kinds of high-dimension Boolean and discrete problems, and provides a forum for
researchers and engineers from different disciplines to exchange ideas. The workshop is
devoted to theoretical discoveries, as well as practical applications. An aim of the
workshop is to initiate possible collaborative research, and to find new areas of
application. It is intended to publish the papers in proceedings.

The invited speakers will be:

* Mitch Thornton (SMU Dallas (Texas), USA),
* Jaap van den Herik (Tilburg University, Netherlands), and
* Shinobu Nagayama (Hiroshima City University, Japan)

 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Theory
* Properties and applications of Boolean Algebras
* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Modeling
* Specification of data structures/Algorithms
* Complexity
* Program Systems/Software
* Fundamental software for the solution of Boolean Problems
* Comparison of efficiency
* Practical Applications
* Application of Boolean Algebra in FPGA synthesis
* Quantum logic, reversible logic, and multi-valued logic
* Solution of real-world problems
