Many different encodings for Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints into conjunctive normal form (CNF) have been proposed in the past. The PBLib project starts to collect and implement these encodings to be able to encode PB constraints in a very simple, but effective way.

New features and encodings:
Conditionals added, e.g. x1 and x2 implies PBConstraint, Binary Merge encoding added, Sequential Weight Counter encoding added (for incremental constraints), improved version of Cardinality Networks implemented,  interface to the PBLib is now even more simple, standalone encoder included.
