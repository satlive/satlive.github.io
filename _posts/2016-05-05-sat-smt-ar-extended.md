Full details of the application and registration procedure are
available at the school website (http://ssa-school-2016.it.uu.se/).

### ABOUT:

Satisfiability (SAT), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and
Automated Reasoning (AR) continue to make rapid advances and find
novel uses in a wide variety of applications, both in computer science
and beyond.  The SAT/SMT/AR Summer School aims to bring a select group
of students up to speed quickly in this exciting research area. The
lectures cover both foundational and practical aspects of SAT, SMT,
and AR technologies, and their application.

The school is the first SAT/SMT/AR Summer School, but continues the
successful line of SAT/SMT Summer Schools, which have taken place
annually since 2011. The SAT/SMT/AR Summer School will take place on
June 22-25 2016 in Lisbon, Portugal, in the week before the IJCAR
conference in Coimbra (27 June – 2 July), which in turn is followed by
the SAT conference in Bordeaux (July 5-8). The school takes place at
the Instituto Superior Técnico (IST/UL), University of Lisbon.
