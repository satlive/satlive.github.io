## CONFERENCE SCOPE

The SAT conference is the premier annual meeting for researchers focusing on
the theory and applications of the propositional satisfiability problem,
broadly construed. Aside from plain propositional satisfiability, the scope
of the meeting includes Boolean optimization (including MaxSAT and
Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints), Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF),
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for
problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

Many hard combinatorial problems can be tackled using SAT-based techniques,
including problems that arise in Formal Verification, Artificial Intelligence,
Operations Research, Computational Biology, Cryptology, Data Mining, Machine
Learning, Mathematics, et cetera. Indeed, the theoretical and practical
advances in SAT research over the past twenty years have contributed to
making SAT technology an indispensable tool in a variety of domains.
