First Workshop on Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice in Constraint Solvers

This one-day workshop will be held at [CP 2014, the 20th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming](http://cp2014.a4cp.org), on Monday 8 September 2014 in Lyon, France.


## Aims and scope

For several years now, CP and SAT solvers have made tremendous advances that allow them to solve very large instances.
If the methods used to achieve this efficiency in practice are well-known, there does not exist to date any analytical explanation to justify the operational efficiency that seems totally at odds with the theoretical complexity of the problems addressed.

On the other hand, many studies have been developed for a long time on the detection of tractable classes in different areas or formalisms such as CSP, SAT, in planning, etc.
But these tractable classes are hardly ever used in practice and thus are generally not explicitly implemented in the solvers.

However, these two bodies of work seem to have been developed in parallel rather than in synergy, creating a real gap between these two aspects of constraint programming.
The purpose of this workshop is to better understand the reasons for the effectiveness of solvers, and also promote exchanges between researchers from both sides of the CP communities with the aim to reduce the gap between these two types of work.

The expected contributions cover a wide spectrum ranging from theoretical works on tractable classes, to implementations of solvers. They also concern the work on performance analysis of solvers. And ideally, work on the study of the properties explaining the behavior of efficient solvers.
We solicit original papers, but papers already published in journals or presented in conferences, particularly if they associate theory and practice are welcome.
This call for papers also includes position papers aimed at creating constructive and fruitful discussion between researchers working in theory and practice.
The workshop will be held as a full-day or half-day workshop. Please note that workshop-participants need to be registered for the workshop.

This workshop would like to bring together researchers interested in :
- implementation of solvers
- optimization of solvers
- analysis of solvers
- study and analysis of benchmarks
- experimentations
- analysis of practical efficiency
- competition of solvers
- complexity analysis
- tractability
- tractable classes
- complexity theory

## Sponsorship

This workshop is sponsored by the Project TUPLES (http://www.lsis.org/tuples/) :
Tractability for Understanding and Pushing forward the Limits of Efficient Solvers
of the French National Agency for Research.
