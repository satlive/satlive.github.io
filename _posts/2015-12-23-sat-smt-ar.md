This year, the SAT/SMT summer school joins forces with the automated reasoning community to propose a SAT/SMT/AR summer school right before IJCAR.

The summer school will take place from June 22 to June 25 in Lisbon, Portugal. IJCAR is taking place in Coimbra, Portugal, from June 27 to July 2.

The SAT conference will take place in Bordeaux, France, from July 4 (workshops) to July 8.
