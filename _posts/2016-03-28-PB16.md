The site for submitting pseudo-Boolean solvers or benchmarks to the
2016 competition will open soon. Like the previous evaluations and
competitions (PB05, PB06, PB07, PB09, PB10, PB11, PB12, PB Evaluation
2015), the goal of PB16 is to assess the state of the art
in the field of pseudo-Boolean solvers.

We invite every author of pseudo-Boolean benchmarks or solvers to
submit them.
