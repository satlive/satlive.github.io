The pseudo Boolean evaluation 2015 analyzes the current state of the
art of pseudo Boolean solving technology to be able to determine the
progress that has been made since the last evaluation. Therefore, we
invite solver developers to submit the latest version of their tools.
Furthermore, we will include selected solvers of the previous pseudo
Boolean competition 2012.

Additionally, we would like to see whether there is the need of novel
solving technology. This should reflect in novel pseudo Boolean
formulas both from academia and industry.

This evaluation tries to show the current state of the art as well as
possible. Hence, we will evaluate both open source reasoners, as well
as closed-source solutions. We will make all data we collect publicly
available afterwards.
