    FIRST CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
    
    
    Fourth International SAT/SMT Summer School
    
    Semmering, Austria, July 10-12, 2014

## REGISTRATION


The registration deadline for the summer school is April 19, 2014.
Full details of the registration procedure as well as travel and
accommodation grants are available at the school website
(http://satsmt2014.forsyte.at/).

## ABOUT

Satisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers
have become the backbone of numerous applications in computer science,
such as automated verification, artificial intelligence, program
synthesis, security, product configuration, and many more. The summer
school covers the foundational and practical aspects of SAT and SMT
technologies and their applications.

Besides providing a well structured introduction to SAT and SMT, this
year’s edition of the SAT/SMT Summer School covers timely topics and
novel applications such as

* parallel solvers,
* theories with quantifiers,
* the IC3 model checking paradigm,
* hardware and software verification,
* proofs and Craig interpolation,
* and cryptography,

presented by distinguished speakers and experts in these fields. In
addition to the theory sessions, we will have practicals in which the
participants will work state-of-the-art tools and solvers.

The fourth edition follows the schools that took place at MIT (SAT/SMT
Solver Summer School 2011), at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (SAT/SMT
School 2012) in Trento, Italy, and Aalto University in Espoo, Finland
in 2013.  The school location and schedule has been chosen to
integrate nicely with the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL 2014,
seehttp://vsl2014.at/). As a reminder, VSL 2014 includes, among many
other events:

* the 17th International Conference on Theory and Applications of
Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2014)

* the 26th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2014)

* the 12th International Workshop on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT 2014)

* the 7th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR 2014)


The Summer School program will feature four lectures per day, with the
first two days dedicated to SAT and SMT, and the last to special
topics. Two of the lectures will be organized as tutorials giving
hands-on experience on SAT/SMT-based modelling.
