## STUDENT GRANTS

A limited number of student travel support grants of up to 600 Euro
per person are available from the SAT Association. Applicants should
acquire a letter of support from their advisor and prepare a statement
detailing why the travel support is needed. This information should be
emailed to the SAT'15 conference chairs at sat2015@easychair.org
by August 31st, 2015. Determinations will be made shortly thereafter.

## CONFERENCE SCOPE

The SAT conference is the premier annual meeting for researchers focusing on
the theory and applications of the propositional satisfiability problem,
broadly construed. Aside from plain propositional satisfiability, the scope
of the meeting includes Boolean optimization (including MaxSAT and
Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints), Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF),
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), and Constraint Programming (CP) for
problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

Many hard combinatorial problems can be tackled using SAT-based techniques,
including problems that arise in Formal Verification, Artificial Intelligence,
Operations Research, Computational Biology, Cryptology, Data Mining, Machine
Learning, Mathematics, et cetera. Indeed, the theoretical and practical
advances in SAT research over the past twenty years have contributed to
making SAT technology an indispensable tool in a variety of domains.
