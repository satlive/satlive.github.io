The Constraint Reasoning and Optimization group, led by Dr. Matti 
Jarvisalo at the University of Helsinki, Finland, is looking for one 
or more talented and highly motivated postdoctoral researchers to
work with us.

The positions are related to our current projects

-Decision Procedures for the Polynomial Hierarchy, 
 Boolean Optimization, and Model Counting;
and 
-Harnessing Constraint Reasoning for Structure Discovery.

Postdoc periods from six months up to two years can be considered,
with a possibility of extending the contract under mutual agreement. 
Starting times are negotiable, primarily within 2015. 
Candidates are expected to have	gained their doctorate before the 
start of the postdoc period (not necessarily at the time of applying). 

The salary of a starting postdoc is around 3300-3500 EUR per month 
before taxes. Health care is included, and money for
traveling (to international conferences and research visits) is 
available.

Individuals with strong implementation skills and/or a strong theory 
background  (ideally, a combination of both) are encouraged to apply. 
The research focus will be tailored to fit the background and interests 
of the successful applicants. Previous research experience in 
SAT/SMT/ASP/CP/MIP, in terms of either solver development, declarative 
modelling, or theoretical analysis, is expected, as witnessed e.g. by 
published papers in well-established international conferences 
(such as IJCAI, AAAI, KR, CP, SAT, UAI, IJCAR, CADE, FMCAD, TACAS, 
ICALP, ICAPS, ICLP, or similar) and/or related journals.

To apply, please send the following information as a *single* PDF
file by email to matti.jarvisalo[AT]cs.helsinki.fi .

1. CV
2. List of publications
3. Copy of PhD certificate or equivalent

4. Statement of research interests (at most four pages)
5. Names and contact information of at least two persons
   willing to provide letters of recommendation
6. Proposed postdoc period (starting time, length)

For full consideration, apply by March 2, 2015.
Applications may be reviewed as they are received, and new 
applications will be accepted until the positions are filled.
