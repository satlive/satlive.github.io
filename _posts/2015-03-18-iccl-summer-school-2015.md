The summer school "Reasoning" is a platform for knowledge transfer
within a very rapid increasing research community in the field of
"Computational Logic". We will offer introductory courses covering
the fundamentals of reasoning, courses at advanced levels, as well
as applied courses and workshops dedicated to specialized topics
and the state of the art. All lecturers are leading researchers in
their field and have been awarded prizes.

A limited number of grants for students and university employees will be available, which includes a waiver for the participation fee.

For the participants of the summer school, the participation at the
38th German AI conference, also held at TU Dresden, is free of
charge.
