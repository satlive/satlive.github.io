SAT Competition 2014

Affiliated with the SAT 2014 conference, July 14-17 in Vienna, Austria,
and the FLoC Olympic Games

SAT Competition 2014 invites submissions of both competing SAT solvers and new competition benchmark instances.

The SAT Competition 2014 is a competitive event for solvers for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem. It is organized as a satellite event to the 17th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2014) and stands in the tradition of the SAT Competitions that have been held yearly from 2002 to 2005 and biannually starting from 2007, the SAT-Races held in 2006, 2008 and 2010, and the SAT Challenge 2012.

The emphasis of SAT Competition 2014 is on evaluation of core solvers. As in SAT Competition 2013, the UNSAT tracks of the competition will require certification.
