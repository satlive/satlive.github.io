    ******************************************************************
    Call for Solvers & Benchmarks
    QBFEVAL'16 - Competitive evaluation of QBF solvers
    
    A joint event with SAT 2016 - The Nineteenth International Conference
    on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - Bordeaux,
    France, July 5-8, 2016
    ******************************************************************


QBFEVAL'16 will be the 2016 competitive evaluation of QBF solvers, and
the eleventh evaluation of QBF solvers and instances ever. QBFEVAL'16
will award solvers that stand out as being particularly effective on
specific categories of QBF instances. The evaluation will run using
the computing infrastructure made available by the University of
Sassari.

We warmly encourage developers of QBF solvers to submit their work,
even at early stages of development, as long as it fulfills some very
simple requirements. We also welcome the submission of QBF formulas to
be used for the evaluation. People thinking about using QBF-based
techniques in their area (e.g., formal verification, planning,
knowledge reasoning) are invited to contribute to the evaluation by
submitting QBF instances of their research problems (see the
requirements for instances). The results of the evaluation will be a
good indicator of the current feasibility of QBF-based approaches and
a stimulus for people working on QBF solvers to further enhance their
tools. For questions, comments and any other issue regarding
QBFEVAL'16, please get in touch with qbf16@qbflib.org.
