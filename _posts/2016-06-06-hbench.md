title: HBench - A new GUI-based platform on Windows for performance benchmarking
author: Ofer Strichman
tags: Tools
excerpt: "HBench provides a simple one-form GUI for managing performance-oriented
research of algorithms. It runs your engine over a set of benchmarks with multiple
parameter sets, collects statistics into a csv file, prepares scatter/cactus plots,
lets the user control the active cores, and much more. It supports both remote
execution on a linux cluster and running on a local windows machine. It makes the
whole benchmarking process much easier."
